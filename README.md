# CS176FinalProject: Youtube Social Network
## By Shreya Raj and Erica Xue

In this repository, you will find the raw source code for our project (CS176_FA24_Raj_Xue_Code.ipynb), the dataset we used (com-youtube.ungraph.txt), and our final project report (CS176_FA24_Raj_Xue_Report.pdf).

This project delves into the analysis of the Youtube social network, a platform that allows user to form friendships and build communities of similar interests. We utilized several critical algorithms and measure such as sampling, graph metrics, centrality measures, and community detection to understand the structure and importance of this social network.
